100xMint-Lab is a robust token creation application designed for the Solana blockchain, crafted by Harkirat Singh during Week 4 of Cohort 3.0. This innovative platform streamlines the process of creating, minting, and burning tokens while offering efficient management of metadata. Users can easily generate new tokens on the Solana blockchain, mint them with customizable properties, and control their supply by burning tokens as needed. The application also facilitates comprehensive metadata management through Metaplex and enables seamless image hosting via Pinata Cloud.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The application leverages a suite of modern technologies to deliver its functionality. Solana serves as the underlying blockchain platform, while Metaplex handles the token metadata management. Pinata Cloud is utilized for uploading and storing token images. The user interface is built with Next.js, a React framework, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. ShadCN is employed for responsive and accessible UI components, and TypeScript is used to enhance code quality through static type checking. Additionally, web3.js, a JavaScript library, enables interaction with the Solana blockchain, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.
